Designer page:
    1. add, delete, and manipulate vertices are the same as base code, except the circle numbering each vertex is hidden in order to avoid overflow. So try not to make a point on a horizontal line without angle. It would confuse players.
       ## You have to decide the shape before spliting.

    2. press "s" with click and drag to split pieces.
       Designer are not allowed to split pieces with too sharp angles.
       IMPORTANT: Finish splitting before move any of them.

    3. press "m" with click and drag to move the splitted pieces. And use "r" and "z" to scale them. Designer cannot move one piece, but scale or rotate another piece. Therefore, for each time manipulating another piece, begin with "m".

    4. Designer cannot make pieces overlap.

    5. make sure always press "A" to save all. Never quit without press "A".

Player page:
    1. press "l" to load puzzle pieces. There is always a puzzle saved for you to play, no need to design before playing.

    2. press "q" with click to select edges. Be able to deselect edges all the time by press "f"

    3. if you select the wrong edge and cause shape twisted, press "r" to reset the piece.
       If you select the wrong edge AND the piece didn't move, please use "f" to reset edges
    IMPORTANT: do not redo when you select the correct edges and the piece matched to its place correctly!

    4. If you find it difficult to continue and want to restart press "e" to escape and re-enter the game. It will reset all your pieces to how it is designed.

    5. Enjoy ;D Remember deselect your last edges to see the win message after you conplete the puzzle!
